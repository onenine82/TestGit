MediaTek settings hierarchy
===========================

Service		org.ofono
Interface	org.ofono.MtkSettings
Object path	[variable prefix]/{modem0,modem1,...}

Methods		dict GetProperties()

			Returns all MtkSettings properties. See the
			properties section for available properties.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InProgress
					 [service].Error.NotImplemented
					 [service].Error.Failed

		void SetProperty(string name, variant value)

			Changes the value of the specified property. Only
			properties that are listed as readwrite are
			changeable. On success a PropertyChanged signal
			will be emitted.

			Possible Errors: [service].Error.InProgress
					 [service].Error.NotImplemented
					 [service].Error.InvalidArguments
					 [service].Error.Failed

Signals		PropertyChanged(string property, variant value)

			This signal indicates a changed value of the given
			property.

Properties	boolean Has3G [readwrite]

			If true, the modem has 3G capabilities, otherwise it is
			just 2G. Only one of the modems can have this set at a
			time (note that in fact the modem hardware is shared
			among all ofono MTK modems, and that each ofono MTK
			modem represents one physical slot in the phone).

			When we set the property to TRUE, all MTK modems are
			reset, and after that this property will be false for
			all modems except for the one for which we set the
			property. Note that setting this property to FALSE is
			not allowed to avoid confusion, as one and only one of
			the modems must have it set to true and we can have
			the case of more than two modems.
